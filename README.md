## Overview
The course consisted of a Group project that allowed us to apply key concepts in Computer science such as Machine Learning models, Cloud technologies and Web development into practice. 

- [Deployed on Google Compute Engine] - http://34.121.255.244/   - **Service suspended**
- [Deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine] - http://34.121.96.143/ - **Service suspended**




## Features
In Group 6, we wanted  to focus on validating data, in particular hotel review data, we sourced our [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/trip-advisor-hotel-reviews) from Kaggle, it consists of reviews from various users within various hotels posted on TripAdvisor.


## Setup & Installation
To run all experiments in this project, you MUST install all required libraries 
listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt). One best way for doing that is to use a virtual environment 
as followings:
```commandline
# go to the working directory
python3.8 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage & Details
Since I had to suspend the Virtual Machine you would either create a clone of the instance, or give me a shout and I can have it running for the purpose of a Demo. 

**Note: Will update soon with Documentation**
