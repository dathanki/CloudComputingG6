## Note
To run all experiments in this project, you MUST install all required libraries 
listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt). One best way for doing that is to use a virtual environment 
as followings:
```commandline
# go to the working directory
python3.8 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
